            Abstract
            In python there is an ability to write python scripts for a variety of projects.<br>
            For this project the python script was written to perform an image comparison.<br>
            This was done with various libraries that are included in the python language.<br>
            These libraries include Image, OpenCV, and etc. Thus, when importing these the<br>
            program would ask the user for two images and the size for the images the program<br>
            would display the pixel values for the images as well as display an image were<br>
            if the pixels of the two images matched the image would be "black out" for that<br>
            section. The team later found out that to compare the images the team needed to<br>
            resize the two images as well as that to have the program run on different computer<br>
            the necessary libraries needed to be on the new computer. Therefore, in the future <br>
            the team decided that the program would need to be more robust and efficient.<br>
