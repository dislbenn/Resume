        Abstract<br><br>
        The Center of Excellence in Remote Sensing Education and Research (CERSER)<br>
        on the campus of Elizabeth City State University is a founding member of SGCI<br>
        led by San Diego Supercomputing Center and the Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI).<br>
        One of the five areas of SGCI is the Workforce Development led by Dr. Linda Hayden.<br>
        Workforce Development aims to nurture the next generation of gateway users<br>
        and developers and engage the potential of students from underrepresented groups.<br>
        As science today grows increasingly computer based, it poses challenges and opportunities<br>
        for researchers. Scientists and engineers are turning to gateways to allow them to analyze,<br>
        share, and understand large volumes of data more effectively. The existence of science<br>
        and engineering gateways and the sophisticated cyberinfrastructure (CI) tools together<br>
        can significantly improve the productivity of researchers. Most importantly,<br>
        science gateways can give uniform access to the cyberinfrastructure that enables<br>
        cutting-edge science. The goal of the web development team was to increase the Interactivity<br>
        of the SGCI Young Professionals site to attract potential members and disseminate information.<br>
        This was completed utilizing WordPress Widgets to provide graphical and interactive components.<br>
        Bootstrap components (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) were also researched for their inclusion into<br>
        the current WordPress Content Management System (CMS) and the future Liferay CMS.<br>

        Knowing the potential leakage inside SGX enclave caused by software<br>
        vulnerabilities, new understandings are needed to mitigate the threat. From that<br>
        which is known, two recent works are published on this topic. SGX-Shield at<br> 
        NDSS'17 proposed load-time randomization, and "Hacking in Darkness: Return-<br>
        oriented Programming against Secure Enclaves" to appear at Usenix Security'17.<br>
        By following the research routine: a basic attack outside SGX to understand ROP,<br>
        the ROP attack inside SGX enclave, and JIT-ROP to bypass SGX-Shield. After we<br>
        can propose mitigation strategies, such as run-time live re-randomization. Both<br>
        parts of JIT-ROP inside SGX and run-time live re-randomization are research<br>
        problems we can try to solve.<br>

        Abstract<br><br>
        In python there is an ability to write python scripts for a variety of projects.<br>
        For this project the python script was written to perform an image comparison.<br>
        This was done with various libraries that are included in the python language.<br>
        These libraries include Image, OpenCV, and etc. Thus, when importing these the<br>
        program would ask the user for two images and the size for the images the program<br>
        would display the pixel values for the images as well as display an image were<br>
        if the pixels of the two images matched the image would be "black out" for that<br>
        section. The team later found out that to compare the images the team needed to<br>
        resize the two images as well as that to have the program run on different computer<br>
        the necessary libraries needed to be on the new computer. Therefore, in the future <br>
        the team decided that the program would need to be more robust and efficient.<br>
